# FragForm: Fragment-level Formulation Design

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results associated with the paper:  
**"Fragment- and composition-aware deep learning for electrolyte formulation design"**

FragForm is a fragment-attribution and composition-aware deep learning framework that links molecular substructures to mixture-level properties, with application to electrolyte conductivity prediction.
